# Natural Language Processing with Classification and Vector Spaces


In Course 1 of the Natural Language Processing Specialization, offered by deeplearning.ai, you will:   

- Perform sentiment analysis of tweets using logistic regression and then na√Øve Bayes

- Use vector space models to discover relationships between words and use PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the vector space and visualize those relationships

- Write a simple English to French translation algorithm using pre-computed word embeddings and locality sensitive hashing to relate words via approximate k-nearest neighbor search.  

By the end of this Specialization, you will have designed NLP applications that perform question-answering and sentiment analysis, created tools to translate languages and summarize text, and even built a chatbot!
